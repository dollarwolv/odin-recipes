    <h1>Oreo Cheeseburger Recipe (Serves 2–3)</h1>
    <img src="../images/hamburger.png">
    <p>Sweet? Savory? Surreal? This burger blends rich beef, melted cheese, and Oreos into a wild culinary experiment.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>600g ground beef (80/20 mix recommended)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 egg (optional, for binding)</li>
        <li>4 slices of melting cheese (e.g. American or mozzarella)</li>
        <li>12 Oreo cookies (plus extra for garnish)</li>
        <li>3 sesame seed burger buns</li>
        <li>Butter or oil for frying</li>
        <li>Optional: a splash of heavy cream for a cookie-infused cheese sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Make the patties</h3>
            <p>Season the ground beef with salt and pepper. Add the egg if desired for a firmer patty. Form into 3–4 thick patties.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the burgers</h3>
            <p>In a hot, lightly oiled pan or grill, cook patties for 4–5 minutes per side until well browned and cooked through. Add cheese slices during the last minute of cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Toast the buns</h3>
            <p>Split the buns and lightly toast the insides in the same pan or grill until golden.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare the cookie layer</h3>
            <p>Twist apart the Oreos and layer the cream side directly on top of the hot cheese, or use whole Oreos between patties for extra crunch. For a more daring touch, melt a few crushed Oreos with cream and drizzle over the patties as a sweet-savory sauce.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Assemble the burger</h3>
            <p>Layer your burger like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bottom bun</li>
                <li>Burger patty with cheese</li>
                <li>Oreos (whole or halves)</li>
                <li>Another burger patty + cheese</li>
                <li>More Oreos</li>
                <li>Top bun</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Repeat the stack if you're going for a monster build, as seen in the image.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Serve</h3>
            <p>Serve immediately while the cheese is gooey. Expect strange looks and possibly applause.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>This one's not for the faint of heart—or for purists. But it’s certainly unforgettable.</p>
